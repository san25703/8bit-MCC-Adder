# 8-bit Manchester Carry Chain (MCC) Adder

## Overview
This project involves the design and implementation of an 8-bit Manchester Carry Chain (MCC) adder for optimum performance. The design is implemented using Cadence Virtuoso with the GPDK 180 nm technology library. The MCC adder achieves high-speed addition with modular design.

## Features
- Modular design for scalability.
- Simulation at multiple frequencies to determine performance.
- Reports on area, power consumption, and area-delay product.

## Project Contents
- **Schematic and Layout Files**: Includes MCC 1-bit and MCC 8-bit schematic and layout designs.
- **Testbench**: MCC8 testbench for functional verification.
- **Simulation Results**: Waveform outputs at different frequencies (100 MHz, 200 MHz, etc.).
- **Reports**: Area, power consumption, and area-delay product analysis.

## Results
- **Maximum Input Frequency**: 200 MHz.
- **Area**: 12,268.61 μm².
- **Power Consumption**: 524.6 μW.
